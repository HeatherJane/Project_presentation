The staff glides effortlessly across the mosaic-tiled floor, tending to guests' every whim and fancy.The menu explores the area where Italy and France meet—along the border regions of Liguria and Provence—by way of three- four- or five-course meals. The chef's skill truly shines when he puts his practiced hands to perfect house-made pastas tossed in luxe ingredients, like garganelli verdi or risotto studded with meaty blue foot mushrooms and Piave Vecchio. Seafood is particularly well-executed here, as in the black bass with escargots in a garlic-parsley-and butter sauce, or the raw scallops with pickled and sweet kohlrabi with a hint of heat from mustard oil and a smoky pop from the roe. Strawberry sorbet topped with whipped crème frâiche tastes of childhood summers and cleanses the palate.

Seafood is particularly well-executed here, as in the black bass with escargots in a garlic-parsley-and butter sauce, or the raw scallops with pickled and sweet kohlrabi with a hint of heat from mustard oil and a smoky pop from the roe.

The chef's skill truly shines when he puts his practiced hands to perfect house-made pastas tossed in luxe ingredients, like garganelli verdi or risotto studded with meaty blue foot mushrooms and Piave Vecchio. Seafood is particularly well-executed here, as in the black bass with escargots in a garlic-parsley-and butter sauce, or the raw scallops with pickled and sweet kohlrabi with a hint of heat from mustard oil and a smoky pop from the roe.

The staff glides effortlessly across the mosaic-tiled floor, tending to guests' every whim and fancy.The menu explores the area where Italy and France meet—along the border regions of Liguria and Provence—by way of three- four- or five-course meals. The chef's skill truly shines when he puts his practiced hands to perfect house-made pastas tossed in luxe ingredients, like garganelli verdi or risotto studded with meaty blue foot mushrooms and Piave Vecchio. Seafood is particularly well-executed here, as in the black bass with escargots in a garlic-parsley-and butter sauce, or the raw scallops with pickled and sweet kohlrabi with a hint of heat from mustard oil and a smoky pop from the roe.
